## Project Notes

I wanted to take a moment to note a couple thoughts on this project. I realize that the user does not have a way to cancel the while loop as I added a loop to make sure they enter a value. I tried to navigate to a way where the user could choose to stop the whole process, but could not get it to work successfully. I got to where if they cancel out of the passLength prompt and the series of confirms would not execute but the given password in the box became undefined. I was not sure if it was better/worse to have undefined if they exit or if they could not exit. I decided to leave it the way I had originally where they are stuck until they enter all values.
